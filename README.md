# Clustering r/NBA post Titles

## The Problem

On many subreddits, posts can be labeled by what "type" post they are which can be helpful for finding specific types of content you're interested in finding. However, these labels are often unreliable. In the NBA subreddit, a post can be tagged as a "rostermove" if it's speculating on a player signing a contract, for example:

However a post about the same player, when they ACTUALLY sign a contract can go untagged
